Installing Scala
================

	Scala can be installed in any Unix or windows based system. 
	Below are the steps to install for Ubuntu (14.04) for scala version 2.11.7. 
	I am showing the steps for installing Scala (2.11.7) with Java version 7. 
	It is necessary to install Java before installing Scala. You can also install latest version of Scala(2.12.1) as well.

	Step 0: Open the terminal

	Step 1: Install Java	

	$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

	If you are asked to accept Java license terms, click on “Yes” and proceed. Once finished, let us check whether Java has installed 
	successfully or not. To check the Java version and installation, you can type:

	$ java -version

	Step 2: Once Java is installed, we need to install Scala

	$ cd ~/Downloads
	$ wget http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.7.deb
	$ sudo dpkg -i scala-2.11.7.deb
	$ scala –version
	
	This will show you the version of Scala installed.
	
	Then type 'scala' in terminal, it will login to scala.
	
	$scala
	scala> 
	
Method 2: Installing Scala in Windows

	3. Just install scala by double click that msi and its like normal installation.
	4. After the installation of scala msi file then we can login to scala by simply typing 'scala' in cmd.
